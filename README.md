# CPP Staring from 0
I made a repository as I am learning C++ from BroCode's yt channel. I will regularly update  this repo as I learn more!

link for the video: https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI?si=e66VGQH6CooQYPMl

However, these files are not exact copies of what was taught in the video. I have modified and added some functions, changed variable names and wrote different parts of code in my style on my level of understanding, but the logic remainns the same.


## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup & Tools

This project was developed using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**. To ensure a smooth experience, I recommend installing the following extensions:


**C/C++ Extension Pack** | Microsoft | Provides core C/C++ language support, debugging, and IntelliSense. 
**C++ Quick Start Snippets** | Dan | Speeds up coding with common C++ templates and snippets. 
**Code Runner** | Jun Han | Easily compile and run code snippets or full files directly from the editor. 
**Code Spell Checker** | Street Side Software | Helps maintain professional code by catching spelling mistakes in comments and strings. 
**Colorful Comments** | Parth Rustogi | Uses different colors for comments (e.g., TODO, NOTE) to improve readability. 
**Indent Rainbow** | oderwat | Visually highlights code indentation to make it easier to spot alignment issues. 

You can find all of these extensions by searching their names in the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.
