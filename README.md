# CPP Staring from 0
I made a repository as I am learning C++ from BroCode's yt channel. I will regularly update  this repo as I learn more!

link for the video: https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI?si=e66VGQH6CooQYPMl

However, these files are not exact copies of what was taught in the video. I have modified and added some functions, changed variable names and wrote different parts of code in my style on my level of understanding, but the logic remainns the same.
